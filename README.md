# Gene-Caller

A set of tools to define gene boundaries *de novo* from only a nucleotide sequence. The basic caller works rather well for prokaryotic genomes shown below for the case of MG1655v3 (the most current genomic anotation for a common laboratory strain of *Escherichia coli*):

In the case of genes on the positive strand, all are identified, with the exception of four targets that use alternative start sites: *hupB*, *yciS*, and *yebB* (GTG) and *yjgZ* (TTG).
